# code-assess

Hey Kuali folks,

This was a fun coding exercise. I've had the thought a number of times riding elevators day in and day out at work to write a simulator for it but have never taken the time to do so. So I can scratch it off my bucket list now. :) Thanks!

I completed in 2 hours (see timestamps). After my final commit I reviewed the requirements and see that I came up a little short on #6. In my head, i was focused on making sure an elevator could get to a user first and then a later step would specify which floor was the destination (which I never coded and didn't stub because I ran out of time). Just wanted to note it here.
